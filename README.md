# Mesh-Destruction-OpenGL-Demo
This demo shows how using the geometry shader can visually displace a mesh, such as if a sledgehammer hit a wall and bented it. Once the mesh is hit over 4 times, a compute particle system plays to represent the debris flying off as the mesh is fully penetrated. This demo was built with walls in mind, but any mesh can be loaded in and will work.
